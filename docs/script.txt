Hi, I'm presenting Spec-Logic for the Algolia Agent Studio Challenge. <break time="0.5s" /> Spec-Logic is an AI-powered PC building assistant tool, and this project falls under the Consumer-Facing Non-Conversational Experiences category.

<break time="1s" />

The challenge asked us to build smart enhancements that proactively assist users within existing workflows. The key requirement was to inject intelligence without requiring explicit back-and-forth conversation. <break time="0.5s" /> One of the specific examples mentioned in the challenge was PC building with knowledge of compatibility of different components. <break time="0.5s" /> That's exactly what Spec-Logic delivers.

<break time="1.5s" />

Let me start by explaining the problem we're solving. <break time="0.5s" /> Building a custom PC is notoriously difficult because of the complex web of compatibility requirements. For example, <break time="0.3s" /> an AM4 socket CPU will only work with an AM4 motherboard. <break time="0.3s" /> DDR4 memory is completely incompatible with DDR5 motherboards. <break time="0.3s" /> A graphics card might be physically too long to fit inside your chosen case. <break time="0.3s" /> High-end GPUs like the RTX 4090 can spike to twice their rated power draw, requiring careful PSU selection.

<break time="0.8s" />

Current solutions like generic AI chatbots lack the structured data needed to enforce hard compatibility rules. <break time="0.5s" /> Spec-Logic solves this by automatically filtering out incompatible options and displaying visual compatibility badges, all without requiring the user to ask any questions.

<break time="1.5s" />

Now let me walk you through the core user experience. <break time="0.5s" /> When you land on the build page, you see seven component categories: <break time="0.3s" /> CPU, Motherboard, Graphics Card, Memory, Power Supply, Case, and CPU Cooler.

<break time="1s" />

The magic happens when you make your first selection. <break time="0.5s" /> Let's say I choose an AMD Ryzen 5 5600X processor. This is an AM4 socket CPU that only supports DDR4 memory. <break time="0.5s" /> The moment I add it to my build, something powerful happens behind the scenes. <break time="0.8s" /> I call this the Lock-In moment.

<break time="1.2s" />

When I now open the motherboard selection, <break time="0.3s" /> Spec-Logic has automatically filtered the results to show only AM4 socket motherboards. <break time="0.5s" /> I didn't ask for this. I didn't type any filters. <break time="0.5s" /> The system proactively applied compatibility constraints based on my CPU selection. <break time="0.5s" /> You'll notice a message at the top saying how many incompatible components are being hidden. Every visible component displays a compatibility badge. <break time="0.3s" /> Green means fully compatible. <break time="0.3s" /> Yellow indicates a warning that needs attention.

<break time="1s" />

When I select a case, the build summary sidebar immediately displays the actual product image of that case, giving users a visual preview of what their build will look like.

<break time="1s" />

The same intelligence applies throughout the build process. <break time="0.3s" /> When I select memory, only DDR4 options appear because that's what my CPU and motherboard support. <break time="0.3s" /> When I browse cases, the system checks GPU clearance and cooler height limits. <break time="0.5s" /> The build summary sidebar updates in real-time, showing selected components, total price, and a power analysis meter that calculates whether my chosen PSU has enough headroom.

<break time="1.5s" />

One feature I'm particularly proud of is the visual case preview. <break time="0.5s" /> When you select a PC case, the build summary sidebar displays the actual product image of that case. This required enriching the component data with high-quality product imagery.

<break time="0.8s" />

I sourced case images by cross-referencing the PCPartPicker dataset with manufacturer product pages and retailer listings. For each case in the database, I downloaded product photos and stored them in the application's public assets folder. <break time="0.5s" /> The ETL pipeline then associates each case record with its corresponding image URL. When the data is uploaded to Algolia, each case entry includes this image URL field. <break time="0.5s" /> This visual feedback helps users see exactly what enclosure their build will live in, making the configuration experience more tangible and engaging.

<break time="1.5s" />

Spec-Logic also includes an AI chat assistant powered by Algolia Agent Studio. <break time="0.5s" /> The chat widget features a combobox-style input with suggested queries to help users get started without having to think of what to ask.

<break time="0.8s" />

You can ask questions like "What CPU should I get for gaming?" or "Is my current PSU sufficient?" <break time="0.5s" /> The AI uses Algolia's search tool to find relevant components and provide contextual recommendations. <break time="0.5s" /> Importantly, the assistant is aware of your current build state. It won't recommend a DDR5 memory kit if you've already selected an AM4 motherboard that only supports DDR4. <break time="0.5s" /> The same compatibility rules that drive the proactive filtering also constrain the AI's recommendations.

<break time="1.5s" />

Let me highlight the specific Algolia features powering this experience.

<break time="1s" />

InstantSearch provides real-time search with sub-200 millisecond latency. This speed is critical because users expect immediate feedback when browsing components.

<break time="0.8s" />

Faceted Filtering enables filtering by socket type, memory type, brand, form factor, and price range. These facets update dynamically based on the current result set.

<break time="0.8s" />

Query Rules automatically detect component patterns. When someone searches for Ryzen 5600X, the system recognizes it's an AM4 CPU and applies the appropriate socket filter without any user intervention.

<break time="0.8s" />

Agent Studio powers the AI chat assistant. The system prompt enforces hard compatibility rules and instructs the AI to always explain why a recommendation fits or doesn't fit the current build.

<break time="0.8s" />

Custom Ranking ensures results are sorted by performance tier and price, helping users find the best value options quickly.

<break time="1.5s" />

Now a quick overview of the technical architecture and how we built the data layer.

<break time="1s" />

For the component data, I searched Kaggle for PC hardware datasets and found several comprehensive sources covering CPUs, GPUs, motherboards, RAM, and power supplies. <break time="0.5s" /> These datasets contained the raw specifications like socket types, TDP ratings, memory compatibility, and physical dimensions that are essential for compatibility checking. <break time="0.5s" /> I also scraped PCPartPicker for additional component data including cases and coolers with their detailed specifications.

<break time="1s" />

The backend uses a Python ETL pipeline to extract this data, transform it, and load it into Algolia. <break time="0.5s" /> The pipeline normalizes inconsistent socket names like "LGA 1700" versus "LGA1700", derives compatibility tags for each component, and enriches records with calculated fields like performance tier.

<break time="1s" />

When creating the Algolia index, I configured searchable attributes to include model names, brands, and component types. <break time="0.3s" /> I set up faceting attributes for socket type, memory type, form factor, and price range to enable the dynamic filtering. <break time="0.3s" /> I also configured custom ranking to prioritize components by performance tier first and price second, so users see the best value options at the top of results.

<break time="1s" />

The frontend is built with Next.js 14, React, and shadcn/ui components. This stack provides a modern, accessible user interface with excellent performance characteristics.

<break time="0.8s" />

Build state is persisted with Zustand so users can return to their configuration later. The state is saved to local storage and automatically rehydrated when the page loads.

<break time="0.8s" />

The export feature generates PCPartPicker format and Reddit markdown, making it easy to share builds with friends or post them to enthusiast communities.

<break time="1.5s" />

The key insight of this project is that most of the intelligence happens without any conversation. <break time="0.5s" /> When I selected that AM4 CPU, the system proactively updated all search filters, calculated power requirements, checked physical clearances, and applied compatibility badges to every visible component. <break time="0.5s" /> This is contextual data retrieval enhancing user experience, <break time="0.3s" /> exactly what the challenge asked for.

<break time="1s" />

The AI chat is available for users who want to ask questions, but the core value proposition works entirely through proactive assistance embedded in the browse and select workflow.

<break time="1.5s" />

In conclusion, <break time="0.3s" /> Spec-Logic demonstrates how Algolia Agent Studio can power intelligent, proactive experiences that guide users through complex decisions. <break time="0.5s" /> The combination of fast retrieval, structured data, and AI assistance creates a seamless PC building experience that prevents compatibility mistakes before they happen.
